Hello! I'm an aspiring data scientist with a physics PhD from The Ohio State University.

# Current Projects
* Filling holes in knowledge in preparation for data science interviews.

# Previous Work
* Attended the Spring 2021 Data Science Bootcamp at [The Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/). The bootcamp culminated in creating [Willow: A Medicinal Tree](https://github.com/NickMacro/erdos-covermymeds-project) with [Sandrine Müller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandrinermuller/) and [Tomas Kasza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-kasza/) using simulated patient data provided by [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/).
* Worked in the Zhong Group at The Ohio State University. My research was at the intersection of biochemistry, physics, and computation to understand how water interacts with protein surfaces.
